# ITC539-MobileAppDev
This is the files for my final assessment in ITC539 Develop Mobile Applications. The code is in C# and was worked in Xamarin Studio for both Mac and Windows 10. I achieved a Credit grade for this application

## Process

I provided a project proposal for the mobile app I was to create within the 13 weeks of the trimester. The project I chose to do was a motor vehicle log. In the proposal I was required to provide the class diagrams, wireframes / storyboard of the application along with use case diagrams and a screen map.

## Development Environment 

I work predominantly in the MacOs world. I do have a Windows 10 laptop however I tend to develop everything via either my MBP or iMac. I used Xamarin Studio to produce the code in C# using a MVC architecture
